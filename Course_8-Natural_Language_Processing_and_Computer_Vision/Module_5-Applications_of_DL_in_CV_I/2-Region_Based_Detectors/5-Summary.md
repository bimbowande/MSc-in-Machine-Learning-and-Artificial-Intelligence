# Summary

With this, you have reached the end of this session. In this session, you learnt about one of the ‘not-so-popular approaches’ to deal with object detection tasks. Region-based models are currently not used in the industry for object detection due to various limitations, one of which is slow speed. In this session, you learnt about these models theoretically. This high-level knowledge of these models is important for you to understand the evolution of object detection algorithms.

Even though the RCNN series of algorithms have various issues and are not used in the industry nowadays, its high-level understanding was important to understand the evolution of object detection algorithms.

Some important points from the video above can be summarised as follows:

1.  First, you understood why fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) cannot be used for object detection tasks due to several shortcomings.  
     
2.  You revisited the concept of sliding windows to understand how they divide the input image into a subset of smaller images.  
     
3.  Next, you were introduced to a region-based approach to solving object detection problems.   
     
4.  You learnt about RCNN and its modifications fast RCNN and faster RCNN.  
     
5.  You were introduced to the concept of region proposal networks for selecting regions from an image.  
     

In spite of all these advancements, this approach is not compatible with real-time problems and is therefore not actively used in the industry today. There is another approach to solve this problem: **One-shot detectors.** You will learn about one-shot detectors in the next session.
