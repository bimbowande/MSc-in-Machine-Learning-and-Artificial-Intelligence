# Introduction

Let’s come to the session on Minikube and Kubeflow concepts. In the previous two sessions, you have learnt about Kubernetes. 

Minikube is a single-node Kubernetes cluster that is deployed using a virtual machine on your local machine. It is used to learn Kubernetes.

While on the other hand, Kubeflow is an open-source Kubernetes platform for developing, orchestrating, deploying and running scalable and portable ML workloads. Kubeflow is an ML platform, which is designed to use ML pipelines to orchestrate complicated workflows running on Kubernetes clusters.

Kubeflow can also be used to deploy ML systems to various environments for development, testing, and production-level serving.

Here in this session, you will also learn how to install Kubeflow, Minikube and supporting tools on EC2. Once all the installation is done, you will see that you will be able to access the Kubeflow dashboard through EC2 instance.  

**In this session, you will learn:**

1.  What is Minikube
2.  Kubeflow introduction
3.  Kubeflow workflow and its application
4.  Kubeflow user interface
5.  Installing Docker and Minikube on Ubuntu EC2
6.  Installation of Kubeflow
