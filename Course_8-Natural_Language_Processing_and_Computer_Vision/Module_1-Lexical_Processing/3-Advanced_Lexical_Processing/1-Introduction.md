# Introduction

In the previous session, you learnt all the basic lexical processing techniques, such as removing stop words, tokenisation, stemming and lemmatisation.

If you recall the three-step model building process that you learnt in the last session, all these techniques make up the first step, that is, text cleaning. 

## In this session

At the beginning of this session you will learn 

1.  Feature extraction
2.  Model building 

**Feature Extraction**  
Process of extracting features from clean text data is known as feature extraction. As you have already learnt, tokenisation is the first step of the feature extraction process. In this session, let’s learn two different techniques that can extract features: bag of words (BoW) and term frequency and inverse document frequency (TFIDF).

**Model Building**  
The model building process is quite similar to that you have already learnt. In this process, the features that are extracted from the text are used to build a machine learning model. The model building process will be illustrated through a real-life case study: classification model on IMDB reviews. 

In the later half of the session, you will learn two more lexical techniques: cosine similarity and language models. The cosine similarity model is used to find documents that are similar to any given document. And the n-gram model is used to predict the next word in the given sequence of words or sentence based on certain rules. The applications of n-gram models are all around us, such as the Google keyboard, where the next word is predicted.   
 
## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this session, other than, knowledge of the previous session and the previous module.
