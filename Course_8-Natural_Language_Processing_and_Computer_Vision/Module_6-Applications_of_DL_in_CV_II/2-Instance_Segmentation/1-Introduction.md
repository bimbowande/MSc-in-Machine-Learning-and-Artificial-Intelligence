# Introduction

Welcome to the session on ‘**Instance Segmentation**’. 

The previous session covered the concept of image segmentation. It mainly focused on the first type of image segmentation - semantic segmentation. Now, this session will cover instance segmentation. As mentioned earlier, this technique segments each instance of a class separately in the image.

The session will focus on one of the most popular architectures used for instance segmentation, Mask R-CNN. This architecture is based on the Faster R-CNN architecture, covered as part of the object detection module. The session will help you with a basic understanding of the following components of the architecture:

-   Backbone model
-   Region Proposal Network
-   Regions of Interest (RoI Align)
-   Segmentation mask

The key learning of the module is associated with the case study based on oil tanker segmentation using the Mask R-CNN framework. As part of the exercise, you will learn how to obtain masks from the bounding boxes.
