# Overview of NLP

Natural language processing (NLP) is a sub field of machine learning (ML) which deals with processing of linguistic data. Why is this an important field of studies in ML? Think of ways in which you interact with the world every day. You read lots of articles, newspapers, tweets, blogs and so on. Text is still the primary way of communication. So, the text around you holds a lot of information. NLP is a way to make text machine understandable. In the upcoming video, Dr Balan will introduce NLP and share his views on its use along with some of its domains like lexical processing, syntactic processing and semantic processing.

In the video, you saw a major challenge of a language processing system – process the text such that a machine can understand it. 

Language processing tools have three classes which help convert text to machine understandable form. The following image shows the three classes. This is not an exhaustive list by any means. There are many other tools and techniques which aid language processing. The list is a strong foundation.

In the next segment, you will learn about these NLP subsections in a bit more detail. All the NLP tools are data pre-processing tools that are meant to convert text into machine understandable forms. The parts of NLP discussed earlier will not be able to build end-to-end ML solutions. The following flowchart shows the role of NLP in an ML solution.

Think of an example that you encountered in your daily life; for instance, the email classification that happens in Gmail. All your incoming mails are classified as primary social, promotional and so on. This is a classification task for which the solution must be built on some classification algorithm. The classification part is not special. The part that comes before classification, i.e., converting text data into a form which these algorithms can process, is the part where NLP tools come into picture. This thought process can be extended to neural networks and deep learning as well. Text analytics solutions can also be built by combining deep learning with language processing tools. Summarising, NLP is quite an extensive and flexible field and can be modified to work for numerous different situations. 

#### Word Prediction

Qn: Which class of ML algorithms is used to predict the next most likely word that you might want to type on a smartphone keyboard?

- Classification 

- Clustering 

- Regression 

- Recommendation 

Ans: D. *The output of the model is the most likely word that you might want to type. Recommendation engines are used in such applications.*

Now that you understand the place of NLP tools in the ML flowchart. In the next segment, let’s learn the different classes of tools in the NLP universe.
