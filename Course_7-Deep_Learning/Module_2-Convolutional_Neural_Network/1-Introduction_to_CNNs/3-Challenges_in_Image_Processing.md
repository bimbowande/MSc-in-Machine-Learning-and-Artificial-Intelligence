# Challenges in Image Processing

CNNs are specialised architectures that work particularly well with visual data, i.e., images and videos. They have been largely responsible for revolutionising 'Deep Learning' by setting new benchmarks for many image processing tasks that were very recently considered extremely hard.

Let's start by understanding some common challenges in image processing.

The video summarised the following challenges associated with image processing:

1.  Translational variation: Objects being placed at different locations in the image.

2.  Viewpoint variation: Different orientations of the image with respect to the camera.

3.  Scale variation: Different sizes of the object with respect to the image size.

4.  Illumination conditions: Lighting and illumination in the image.

5.  Background clutter: Inclusion of different elements in the background.

6.  Deformations: Variation in the inherent shape of the object.

The algorithms have to accommodate all the aforementioned variations and still result in the correct output. Therefore, a common task of visual recognition (like identifying a ‘cat’ or a ‘dog’) that is considered simple for humans becomes a big challenge for algorithms. 

  
The next segment will help you understand how humans process visual data to accommodate all these challenges associated with image processing.
