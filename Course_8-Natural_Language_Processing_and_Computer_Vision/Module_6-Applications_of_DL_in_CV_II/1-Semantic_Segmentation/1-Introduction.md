# Introduction

Welcome to the section on **‘Image Segmentation’**. 

The previous sessions focused on object detection. Now, this session will focus on the second application of deep learning in Computer Vision, that is, Image Segmentation. This application is an extension of object detection as instead of bounding boxes, you will now try to mark the **pixels** where the object is present on the screen. 

Let’s hear from Georgios about the module in the upcoming video.

As mentioned above, you will be learning about image segmentation in this module. In simple words, image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments based on their presence in the image.

As seen from the above image, all the pixels are segmented using a particular color based on the different objects present in the image. As part of this module, you will learn about:

-   The difference between the process of object detection and image segmentation
-   Types of image segmentation:
    -   Semantic segmentation
    -   Instance segmentation
-   Different industry applications of image segmentation
-   Architectures:
    -   Encoder-decoder framework
        -   Semantic segmentation
        -   U-Net
    -   Instance segmentation
        -   Mask R-CNN
    -   Other associated concepts
        -   Skip connections
        -   Downsampling and Upsampling
        -   Loss function: Dice Coefficient

Lastly, the module will also help you with two different use cases to learn the practical aspects of image segmentation:

-   Lung segmentation using U-Net
-   Oil tanker segmentation using Mask R-CNN

**In this session**

The first session will deal with the introduction of image segmentation and will dive deeper into the elements of semantic segmentation. With the basic understanding of image segmentation, let’s proceed with how it is different from object detection.
