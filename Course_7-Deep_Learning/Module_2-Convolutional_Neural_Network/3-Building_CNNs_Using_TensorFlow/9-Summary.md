# Summary

In this session, you learnt how to build and train CNNs using the Keras library under TensorFlow and experimented with some of the hyperparameters of the model. The session also helped you in manually computing the number of parameters, output sizes, etc. of CNN-based architectures.

Based on these experiments, you saw that the performance of CNNs depends heavily on multiple hyperparameters, which are the number of layers, number of feature maps in each layer, the use of dropouts, batch normalisation, etc. Thus, it is advisable to first fine-tune your model hyperparameters by conducting lots of experiments. Only after you are convinced that you have found the right set of hyperparameters should you train the model with a larger number of epochs (as the amount of time and computing power you have is almost always limited).

In the next session, you will study the architectures of some popular deep convolutional networks, learn how to use large pretrained networks for your own tasks using transfer learning.
