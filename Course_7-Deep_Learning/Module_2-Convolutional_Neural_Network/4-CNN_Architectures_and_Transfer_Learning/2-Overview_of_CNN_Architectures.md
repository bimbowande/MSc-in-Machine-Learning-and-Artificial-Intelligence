# Overview of CNN Architectures

In this segment, you will get an overview of some of the most popular CNN architectures that have set the benchmark for state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. The acid test for almost all CNN-based architectures has been the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition, or simply ImageNet. The data set contains roughly 1.2 million training images, 50,000 validation images and 150,000 testing images of about 1000 classes.

We will discuss the following architectures in this session:

-   AlexNet
-   VGGNet
-   GoogleNet
-   ResNet

To summarise the important points:

-   The depth of the state-of-the-art neural networks has been steadily increasing (from AlexNet with 8 layers to ResNet with 152 layers).
-   The developments in neural net architectures were made possible by significant advancements in infrastructure. For example, many of these networks were trained on multiple GPUs in a distributed manner. This made the training faster and more efficient.
-   Since these networks have been trained on millions of images, they are good at extracting generic features from a large variety of images. Thus, they are now commonly used as commodities by deep learning practitioners around the world.

You will learn how to use large pretrained networks in a later segment of this session. In the next segment, we will study the architectures of AlexNet, VGGNet and GoogleNet.
