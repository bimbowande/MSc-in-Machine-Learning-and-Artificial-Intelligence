# Deployment

In this segment, you will learn about the final task for this Capstone Project, in which you will deploy your model. In the next video, Arihant will explain the broad-level subtasks that you need to perform to deploy your model.

**VIDEO**

In the video above, you learnt about all the subtasks that you need to perform as part of this project. These subtasks are as follows:

1.  The first step is to choose the best model based on the respective model evaluation metrics **for only Scenario 1** for age prediction and gender prediction.  
    **Note**: We have not included Scenario 2 as part of the deployment, as it would increase the complexity of this problem.
    
2.  As you learnt in the deployment module, you need to export and save the models as pickle files.
    
3.  You need to use the test data set created during the train-test split and integrate it with the flask application.
    
4.  Now, you need to create a flask application that can be exposed as an API endpoint. As part of this task, you need to perform the following subtasks:
    
    -   Design the flask application
        
    -   Dockerize the application
        
    -   Deploy the application on EC2
        

In the next segment, you will learn about these subtasks in much more detail.
