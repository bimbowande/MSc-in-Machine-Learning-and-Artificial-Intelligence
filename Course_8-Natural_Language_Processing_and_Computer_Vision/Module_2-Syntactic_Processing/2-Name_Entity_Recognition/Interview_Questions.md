# Interview Questions

#### Interview Question

Qn: What is syntactic processing?

Ans: *It is a technique of analysing sentences to determine the grammatical structure of a sentence. By conducting syntactic analysis, a machine can analyse and understand the function of words arranged in a sentence. It employs grammar rules to find the structure of sentences.*

Qn: What is PoS Tagging?

Ans: *Parts-of-speech (POS) tagging is used to assign tags to words such as nouns, adjectives and verbs. The software uses POS tagging to first read the text and then differentiate the words by tagging. The software uses algorithms such as rule-based tagging, sequential probability techniques such as the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and deep learning methods for parts-of-speech tagging.*

Qn: What is NER?

Ans: *Named entity recognition (NER) is also referred to as entity chunking or entity identification. It is the task of identifying and categorising the key information that includes entities such as a person, a location, a date or an event in the text. An entity can be any word or a series of words that consistently refers to the same thing.*

Qn: Where can NER be used?

Ans: *NER is suited to any situation in which a high-level overview of a large quantity of text is helpful. With NER, you can, at a glance, understand the subject or theme of a body of text and quickly group texts based on their relevancy or similarity.*

- *Classifying content for news providers*  

- *Automatically summarising resumes using keywords*  

- *Search engine algorithms such as Google Search*  

- *Empowering recommendation systems*  

- *Classifying treatment and diseases in biomedical data sets*

Qn: What are some popular Python libraries that are used for NLP?

Ans: *Top NLP Libraries*

- *Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK): NLTK is one of the leading platforms for building Python programs that can work with human language data.* 

- *Gensim: Gensim is a Python library designed specifically for “topic modeling, document indexing, and similarity retrieval with large corpora.”*

- *CoreNLP: Stanford CoreNLP comprises of an assortment of human language technology tools. It aims to make the application of linguistic analysis tools to a piece of text easy and efficient.*

- *spaCy: spaCy is an open-source NLP library in Python. It is designed explicitly for production usage – it lets you develop applications that process and understand huge volumes of text.*

- *TextBlob: TextBlob is a Python (2 & 3) library designed for processing textual data. It focuses on providing access to common text-processing operations through familiar interfaces.*

- *Pattern: Pattern is a text processing, web mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and network analysis tool for Python. It comes with a host of tools for data mining (Google, Twitter, Wikipedia API, a web crawler, and an HTML DOM parser), NLP (part-of-speech taggers, n-gram search, sentiment analysis, WordNet), ML (vector space model, clustering, SVM), and network analysis by graph centrality and visualization.* 

- *PyNLPl: Pronounced as ‘pineapple,’ PyNLPl is a Python library for Natural Language Processing. It contains a collection of custom-made Python modules for Natural Language Processing tasks. One of the most notable features of PyNLPl is that it features an extensive library for working with FoLiA XML (Format for Linguistic Annotation).*

Qn: What are the real-life examples of syntactic processing?

Ans: *A few real-life examples of syntactic processing are:*

- *Product features categorisation using customer reviews*  

- *Name Entity Recognition (NER) in question answering systems*  

- *NER identification of diseases and treatment in healthcare*   

- *Grammar check of the document*  

- *Heteronym detection*
