# Introduction

So far, you have learnt about the fundamentals of object detection and how to implement pre-trained object detectors to solve real-world problems.

## In this session

You will learn how to create a custom object detector to solve one of the common use cases found during the COVID-19 era. Let’s hear from Georgios as he provides an overview of the topics that will be covered in this session and explains the problem statement for this object detection task.

**VIDEO**

As you learnt in the video above, in this session, you will create a **custom object detector** using the **YOLO algorithm**. You will build a model to detect the presence of face masks in the images of different people.

Please ensure that you are well-versed with the concepts covered in the previous sessions before you get started with this session. Also, open a Google Colab Notebook and start writing the code on your own as you go through this session for a better understanding of this topic.
