# Summary

Let’s hear from Samrat about the elements covered in the first session of the module on convolutional neural networks.

**VIDEO**

As mentioned in the video, you learnt about the basics of convolutional neural networks and their common applications in computer vision such as image classification and object detection. You also learnt that CNNs are not limited to images but can be extended to videos, text, audio, etc. 

The design of CNNs uses many observations from the animal visual system, such as each retinal neuron looking at its own (identical) receptive field, some neurons responding proportionally to the summation over excitatory regions (pooling), and images being perceived in a hierarchical manner. 

You learnt that images are naturally represented in the form of arrays of numbers. Greyscale images have a single channel, while colour images have three channels (RGB). The number of channels or the 'depth' of the image can vary depending on how we represent the image. Each channel of a pixel, usually between 0 and 255, indicates the 'intensity' of a certain colour.

Coming to the CNN architecture, a typical CNN unit (or layer) in a large CNN-based network comprises convolution layers, pooling layers and fully connected layers. In the next session, all these elements will be covered in detail.
