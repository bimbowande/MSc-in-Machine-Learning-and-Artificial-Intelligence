(10%)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Dataset visualisation**           | 8             | - Created a code to visualize one instance of all the nine classes present in the dataset                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Model building and training**     | 18            | - Created a CNN model, which can accurately detect 9 classes present in the dataset.<br>- Provided appropriate reasoning for the selected stride and padding value.<br>- Defined appropriate optimiser and loss function for model training.<br>- Trained the model for ~20 epochs.<br>- Explained the findings after the model fit with evidence if the model overfits or underfits. |
| **Model building and training**     | 16            | - Created a CNN model (with dropout), which can accurately detect 9 classes present in the dataset.<br>- Defined appropriate optimiser and loss function for model training.<br>- Trained the model for ~20 epochs.<br>- Explained the findings after the model fit with evidence if the earlier issue is resolved or not.                                                            |
| **Class distribution**              | 15            | Examined the current class distribution in the training dataset & explained the following:<br><br>- Which class has the least number of samples?<br>- Which classes dominate the data in terms of the proportionate number of samples?                                                                                                                                                |
| **Handling class imbalance**        | 10            | Rectified class imbalances present in the training dataset with Augmentor library                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Model building and training**     | 18            | - Created a CNN model (with mentioned steps), which can accurately detect 9 classes present in the dataset.<br>- Defined appropriate optimiser and loss function for model training.<br>- Trained the model for ~30 epochs.<br>- Explained the findings after the model fit with evidence if the issues are resolved or not.                                                          |
