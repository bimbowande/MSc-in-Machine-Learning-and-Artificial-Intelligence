# Submissions Required

Upload a zip file titled **MLC_CapstoneProject__FinalSubmission_Your Name** containing the following:

1.  All the code files that were used throughout the project. Each file must be well-commented and proper markdown cells must be used to highlight the subtask that has been performed under it.  
    **Note**: The code files should clearly label the following:
    -   Primary Task and Subtask
    -   Data cleaning/feature engineering/data preparation step that is being used
    -   Whether you have used a regression or classification model for age prediction
    -   Whether the model is being built under Scenario 1 or Scenario 2
2.   A folder that includes all the code files used as part of the model deployment task. For example, app.py file, HTML files, pickle files, requirements.txt, etc.
3.  A pdf file **Task3_Modelbuilding.pdf** with the following results:
    1.  **Please mention the approximate amount of contribution made by each member of the group towards the Capstone Project. For example, Student A = 60% and Student B = 40%. There may be a viva towards the end to decide the final marks.**
    2.  Top five rows of the data set at the beginning of the analysis
    3.  List of data cleaning techniques applied such as missing value treatment, etc. 
    4.  Feature engineering techniques that were used along with proper reasoning to support why the technique was used
    5.  Outputs to the various EDA and Visualisation codes along with the corresponding results and the insights gathered from each EDA and visualisation
    6.  Geospatial visualisations along with the insights gathered from this visualisation
    7.  Results interpreting the clusters formed as part of DBSCAN Clustering and how the cluster information is being used
    8.  A brief summary of any additional subtask that was performed and may have improved the data cleaning and feature generation step
    9.  All the data preparation steps that were used before applying the ML algorithm
    10.  Documentation of all the machine learning models that were built along with the respective parameters that were used (e.g., DBSCAN, XGBoost, Random Forest, GridSearchCV, etc.)
    11.  The reason for using regression or classification for age prediction 
    12.  The outcomes of the evaluation metrics (results for both Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 must be shown separately).
4.  A pdf file titled **Task4_ModelDeployment.pdf** with the following results:
    1.  Commands used for deploying the flask application on the ec2 instance 
    2.  The screenshot of the final output for predicting the campaigns for the 50 customers

Note: The documents  **Task3_Modelbuilding.pdf**  and **Task4_ModelDeployment.pdf**  should be well-reported and should include insights gained at each part of the model building and model deployment tasks.
