# Introduction

Welcome to the first module of ‘Natural Language Processing (NLP)’. You must have seen a plethora of NLP applications around you. The auto replies that you get while replying to emails, different voice assistants like Alexa and Siri, product features shown in Amazon product reviews, auto categorisation of emails into primary, social etc., are all examples of models built using raw text data. The sheer volume of text data that is generated every day is tremendous and, hence, a way to digest text data is vital. 

## In This Module 

Lexical processing is the starting point of text analytics. In the video below your primary faculty for this module, Dr. Balan speaks module contents.

**VIDEO**

This module begins by introducing the tools and techniques of NLP. By the end of this module, you should be able to do the following:

1.  Use regular expression to process text 
2.  Pre-process a corpus of text using the NLTK library 
3.  Build a simple text classification model
4.  Get a basic idea of language modelling

You will learn the techniques of lexical processing through Zomato and IMDB reviews data. In these case studies, your objective is to process and sanitise text and then build a sentiment analysis model.
