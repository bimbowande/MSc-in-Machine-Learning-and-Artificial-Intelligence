# Introduction

Welcome to the third session of the module on ‘Convolutional Neural Networks’.

## In this session

In this session, you will learn to train CNNs using TensorFlow libraries. Compared with the previous session, this session will be more hands-on.

Let’s hear from Samrat about this session's agenda.

All of us are surrounded by objects in the real world, for example, a tree, bicycle or a traffic signal. As humans, we have learnt how to identify these objects to give them meaning over time. However, in order for computers to recognise the images of these objects, they need to be trained on several instances of labelled data.

In this session, you will train a neural network to classify different images from the CIFAR10 data set. This data set consists of 60,000 coloured images of 10 classes as shown below. You will also experiment with some of the hyperparameters of CNNs.
