# Introduction

In the previous session, you were introduced to the concept of object detection. You also learnt about some important metrics that you will be using throughout the module. In this session, you will learn about the different types of algorithms for detecting objects in images and videos. There are two categories of object detection algorithms, which are as follows:

1.  Region-based detectors
2.  One-shot detectors

## In this session

You will learn about the first set of algorithms used for object detection: **region-based algorithms.** 

Let’s from Georgios as he provides an overview of the topics that will be covered in his session.

In this session, you will learn about one of the two types of object detection algorithms, region-based algorithms. You will start the session by understanding why you cannot simply use fully convoluted neural networks to solve object detection problems. 

You will then learn about RCNN, Fast RCNN and Faster RCNN, which work on a region proposal technique and are hence known as region-based approaches. You will learn about the workings, architectures and limitations of each of these techniques.

**Note that these methods are not used in the industry today due to various limitations. This session will provide a theoretical overview of these region-based detectors. You will only learn the basics of these techniques for you to understand the evolution of object detection models. In the session after this, you will learn in detail about one-shot detectors which are the most widely used algorithms in the industry.**
