# Web Framework - Flask

Whenever you develop a web application in Python, you need a framework to help you build web applications that can improve the whole deployment process. For this purpose, you will go through the Flask framework, which is majorly used to create web applications to deploy machine learning models.

Before learning how to deploy a model, you must gain an understanding of web frameworks. Let’s hear from Abhay as he walks us through the concept of web frameworks.

Several web frameworks are available, some of which are as follows:

1.  Flask
2.  Django
3.  Tornado
4.  Pyramid

Choosing the right web framework is crucial. To deploy our model, we will choose **Flask.** 

The advantages of using Flask to create web applications are as follows:

1.  More Pythonic than the Django web framework
2.  Easy to set up and simple to use
3.  Extensive documentation
4.  Unit testing support integrate
5.  Built-in development server and debugger
  
In the next video, Abhay will discuss some more details about Flask.

As per Flask’s website:

*"Flask is a lightweight WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks."*

Here, Werkzeug is the WSGI web applications utility library, and Jinja is a web template engine for Python, which has been integrated into Flask.
