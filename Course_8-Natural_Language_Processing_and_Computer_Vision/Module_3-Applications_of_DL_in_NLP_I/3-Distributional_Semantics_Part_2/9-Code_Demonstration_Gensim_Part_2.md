# Code Demonstration - Gensim Part 2

In the previous segments, we have obtained the word embeddings. Let us apply some vector operations on these vectors in this segment.

**VIDEO**

You saw the correlation between word vectors of countries and capitals. You saw that if word vectors are plotted in a scatter plot, the countries belonging to the same continent formed a cluster. 

If you are given the following example. 

India: Delhi 

USA : _____?

We can predict that it is Washington because we understand the relation between these words. In the next video, let’s check if our word vectors can predict these analogies.

**VIDEO**

In this segment, you understood the usage of the Word2Vec function in the gensim library. We applied different vector operations to understand if the words vectors capture the meaning of the words.

Fun exercise!

Check out this fun app - It prints words that are highly correlated to the input word. Try entering any random word, and it will output all the words that are most related to that word along with the similarity score!
