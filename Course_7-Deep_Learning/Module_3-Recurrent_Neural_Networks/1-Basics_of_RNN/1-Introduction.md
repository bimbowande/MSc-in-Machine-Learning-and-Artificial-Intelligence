# Introduction

Welcome to the third module of this course. In this module, you will learn about recurrent neural networks or RNNs. RNNs are specially designed to work with sequential data, i.e., data where there is a natural notion of a 'sequence' such as text (sequences of words, sentences, etc.), videos (sequences of images), speech, etc. RNN and its variations have been able to produce state-of-the-art results in fields such as natural language processing, computer vision and time series analysis.   

Many RNN-based applications have already penetrated consumer products. Take, for example, the auto-reply feature which you see in many chat applications, shown as follows:

You may have noticed auto-generated subtitles on YouTube (and that it has surprisingly good accuracy). This is an example of automatic speech recognition (ASR) which is built using RNNs.

Similarly, when you talk to a support team of a food delivery app, or any other support team for that matter, you get an auto-reply in the initial stages of your interaction where the support team asks about details such as order date, problem description, and other basic things. Many of these conversational systems, informally called 'chatbots', are trained using RNNs.

  
RNNs are also being used in applications other than NLP. Recently, OpenAI, a non-profit artificial intelligence research company, came really close to defeating the world champions of Dota 2, a popular and complex battle arena game. The game was played between a team of five bots (from OpenAI) and a team of five players (world champions). The bots were trained using reinforcement learning and RNNs.

  
Many companies generate music using RNNs. Jukedeck is one such company. Many other problems are yet to be solved, and RNNs look like promising candidates to solve them. You could be the one to make an impact in those areas. With that in mind, let’s start the module by listing out the concepts covered in this module.
