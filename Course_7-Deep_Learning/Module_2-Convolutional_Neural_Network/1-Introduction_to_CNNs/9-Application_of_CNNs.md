# Application of CNNs

In this segment, you will study some common types of image processing tasks which can be solved using CNNs.

Some applications that were discussed in the video are as follows:

-   **Object localisation**: Identifying the local region of the objects (as a rectangular area) and classifying them.

-   **Semantic segmentation**: Identifying the exact shapes of the objects (pixel by pixel) and classifying them.

-   **Optical character recognition (OCR)**: Recognising characters in an image (text from the document or number plates).

Now that you have a broad sense of the different applications of CNNs, let's see some more examples of image processing applications in different industries.

CNNs have various other applications in different sectors such as healthcare, insurance and surveillance. 

-   Many medical imaging applications used in radiology, cardiology, gastroenterology, etc., involve classification, detection and segmentation of objects which can be analysed using CNNs. 
-   The capability of the CNN framework to act as an OCR is leveraged across different industries to generate digital documents from any form of physical documents. 
-   Like the characters, the CNNs can also identify facial patterns and help in different applications like facial recognition and image tagging.
-   Autonomous driving heavily uses object detection and localisation to detect the objects present around the car and help in deciding the next actions accurately. 
-   Moreover, CNNs can also be applied while working with non-visual data like speech signals or time series by identifying the different patterns present in them.

#### Applications of CNN

Qn: Which of the following types of data can be analysed using CNNs? More than one options may be correct.

- Images

- Video

- Audio

- Text

Ans: *CNNs are most commonly used for analysing images. A video is a series of images (or frames). CNNs are commonly used for processing videos. CNN can also be used for audio processing. CNNs can also be applied to text, although their use is limited in this area.*

With this, you have come to the end of session one. The next segment will summarise the concepts covered in this session.
