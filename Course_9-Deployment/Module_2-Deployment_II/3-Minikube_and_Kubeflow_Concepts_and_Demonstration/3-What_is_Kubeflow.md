# What is Kubeflow

In the previous segment, you have been introduced to the Minikube. Now in this segment, you will be introduced with the Kubeflow. 

Kubeflow is used to build and experiment with **ML pipelines**. Kubeflow can also be used to deploy **ML systems** to various environments for **development, testing, and production-level serving.**

**VIDEO**

So, let’s try to understand more about Kubeflow. 

Kubeflow is an open-source Kubernetes platform for developing, orchestrating, deploying and running scalable and portable ML workloads.

There are many things that you need to address apart from model construction and training the ML model. 

You need to address the things, which may include porting the data to an accessible format and location, data cleaning and feature engineering, analyzing the trained models, model versioning and scalable serving of the trained models.

Kubeflow is the solution to all the above concerns, Kubeflow is an ML platform, which is designed to use ML pipelines to orchestrate complicated workflows running on Kubernetes cluster.

In the next segment, you will learn about the Kubeflow workflow.

#### Kubeflow

Qn: Which of the following statements are true about Kubeflow?

- Kubeflow is used for container orchestration.

- Kubeflow is the ML toolkit for Kubernetes.

- Kubeflow builds on Kubernetes as a system for deploying, scaling and managing complex ML systems.

- Kubeflow can monitor the model’s performance, and feed the results into your processes for tuning or retraining the model.

- You can not serve your ML model for online prediction.

Ans: B, C & D.

Qn: What is the key difference between Kubernetes and Kubeflow?

Ans: ***Kubernetes** is an open-source Docker container orchestration system. It handles scheduling the nodes in the cluster and actively manages workloads to ensure that their state matches the users declared intentions.*

*The **Kubeflow** is dedicated to creating the Machine Learning model on Kubernetes easy, portable and scalable. Kubeflow allows engineers to focus on writing ML algorithms instead of managing their operations.*

Qn: Which of the following applications/tools are provided by the Kubeflow?

- TensorFlow

- scikit-learn

- PyTorch

- TensorBoard

- Jupyter Notebook

- XGBoost

Ans: All of the above.
