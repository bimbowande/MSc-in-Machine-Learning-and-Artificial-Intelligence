# Introduction

Welcome to the module on ‘**Applications of DL in CV**’. Computer vision (CV), in simple terms, allows you to understand how a computer perceives and performs different tasks with images, videos, etc.

## In this module

You will learn about two common applications of CV: Object detection and semantic segmentation. You have already learnt about one application of CV earlier in the CNN module: Image classification. Now, you will learn about the other applications, starting with object detection.

## In this session

You will start with learning about one of the two applications of CV: Object detection. The next video will provide you with an overview of this session.

**VIDEO**

This session will introduce you to object detection and the commonly used terms and metrics for creating your own object detector. This session will cover the following topics:

1.  First, you will learn about CV and its common applications. 
2.  Next, you will understand how image classification, which you have learnt about previously, differs from object detection.
3.  Further, you learn about object detection and the concept of ‘image localisation’ and bounding boxes.
4.  Finally, you will learn how to evaluate how accurately an object detection model performs by learning about two important concepts:
    1.  Intersection over union (IoU) and
    2.  Loss functions – L1 and L2 losses.
