# Data Ingestion and Analysis

## ML Lifecycle

In this business scenario, you need to solve an end-to-end business model, which, in the machine learning context, is known as the Machine Learning Life Cycle. Let's watch the next video to learn about the different components of this cycle.

**VIDEO**

In the video above, you learnt about the ML Life Cycle, which you will build while developing your end-to-end model for mapping customers to different marketing campaigns. The machine learning life cycle involves seven major steps, which are as follows:

-   Fetching data
-   Cleaning data
-   Preparing data for the modelling process
-   Training the model
-   Evaluating or Testing the model
-   Deploying the model to production
-   Monitoring the model under production

In this Capstone project, we have broadly classified each of these components into four different tasks, which are as follows:

1.  **Data Ingestion and Analysis**
2.  **Data Preparation for Modelling**
3.  **Model Building**
4.  **Deployment**

Under each task, you will be explicitly informed about the different subtasks that you need to perform. So, let's take a look at your first task: Data Ingestion and Analysis.

## Task 1: Data Ingestion and Analysis

In the next video, Arihant will explain the different subtasks that you need to perform as part of this task.

In the video above, you learnt about the broad-level subtasks that you need to perform as part of the Data Ingestion and Analysis task. The list of subtasks is given below in detail.

1.  **Data ingestion from various data sources**:
    
    -    RDS: Databases (Tables)
        
    -    S3: Metadata 
        
    -    Creating external tables: Here, you need to pull the data from the RDS and S3, move it to the EMR and create the external tables on Hive. 
        
2.  Basic SQL analysis
    
    -   Sanity analysis
        
    -   Count analysis
        
3.  Hive for analytics report
    
    -   HQL queries
        
    -   Creation of internal tables
        
In the next segment, you will get a brief overview of the different SQL and Hive tasks that you need to execute as part of your first task.
