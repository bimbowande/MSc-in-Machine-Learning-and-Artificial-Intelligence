# Introduction to Session

In the previous section, you took a look at knowledge graphs–specifically, WordNet. In knowledge graphs, nodes represent entities, and edges represent the relationships between these entities.

Distributional semantics captures the meaning of words.  Distributional semantics is divided into three sessions as this is an extensive topic. 

We have studied neural networks in the previous module, let us see how we will apply the concepts studied there in distributional semantics.

## This session will cover the following topics:

1.  Importance of distributional semantics
    
2.  A brief intuition of the geometric representation of words
    
3.  Shortcomings of frequency-based approaches of word vectors such as Bag of Words
 

People you will hear from in this session
