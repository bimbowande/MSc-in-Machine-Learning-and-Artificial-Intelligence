# Fundamentals of Lexical Processing

Building machine learning models on text data can broadly be segregated into three steps. In the video provided below, Dr Mahesh will talk about this three-step process.

In this video, you learnt the high-level steps in building a text-based model. The diagram given below shows the steps involved in creating an ML solution from text data.

By the end of this module, you will have gone through all the steps mentioned above. In the next session, you will build a model to predict the sentiments of the users using the IMDB review data set. 

The first step in any language analytics project is text preprocessing. In the video given below, Mahesh will explain the need of preprocessing. 

**VIDEO**

As you saw in this video, user-generated text is usually extremely noisy; it has incorrect grammar, spelling mistakes, use of different cases and a lot of other inconsistencies. For instance, consider the following text. It is a review written by a user for a phone that they bought from Amazon. 

_“Worst Phone I have seen specs amd buyed it but not satisfied I have samsung m21 mobile which has amoled screen and always on display same they mentioned in this Redmi Note 10s but display clarity is worst than LCD and always on display stays only for 10 sec .Worst Camera Performnace wise ok Didnt liked this phone and dont trap for technical gimmiks.”_

Notice the spelling mistakes and grammatical errors in the text. The user also uses digits ‘21’ to denote a specific phone model. All such inconsistencies need to be removed before a model can be built. One might be tempted to ask: Since machines do not understand language as humans do, why do any of these things matter? Can the machine not figure out the pattern in the text as it is? 

You will be able to answer these questions once you learn about feature extraction. For now, let’s say text preprocessing helps reduce noise in the text and convert the text into a machine-readable format. 

#### Lexical Processing

Qn: Which of the following classes of ML techniques can lexical processing be classified into?

- Learning algorithms

- Pre-learning techniques 

- Model evaluation algorithms

- None of these

Ans: B. *Lexical processing of text focuses on making sure that the text is in a digestible form.*

In the video above, Mahesh also spoke about the various techniques used to process text. In the next few segments, you will learn these techniques.
