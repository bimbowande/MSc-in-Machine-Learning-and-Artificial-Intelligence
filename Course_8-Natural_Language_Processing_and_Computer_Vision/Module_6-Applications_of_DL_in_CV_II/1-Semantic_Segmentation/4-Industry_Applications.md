# Industry Applications

Image segmentation finds application in multiple industries due to its advanced nature. This segment will help you with the understanding of such use cases.

**VIDEO**

The video covers the following use cases associated with image segmentation:

1.  **Autonomous driving**:  
    Image segmentation can be applied to the live feed obtained by the visual sensors installed in self-driving cars to detect the path and different objects for a safer experience. As the most basic solution, you can use semantic segmentation to segment the visual into two categories - path and background. If the architecture detects the path, it will move ahead; else, the car would stop. In complex versions, you can identify different classes in the image and train the model to act accordingly for different cases.  
     
2.  **Medical imaging**:  
    Medical image segmentation is the task of segmenting objects of interest in a medical image. This industry provides a rich collection of data from different modalities, such as computed tomography (CT), X-ray, ultrasound, microscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), etc. Image segmentation is helpful in different tasks like organ mapping, disease detection, tumour detection, etc.

3.  **Surveillance**:  
    Image segmentation is also used in tracking the movement of elements like cars, humans, etc. Instance segmentation finds a crucial role here as you can monitor a specific instance through the algorithms.

4.  **Satellite imagery**:  
    Image segmentation can be applied to the images captured by the satellites to get a wholesome understanding of the area under focus. It can help monitor environmental factors such as deforestation, resource distribution, etc. Moreover, you can also train the model to identify assets like ships, oil tanks, buildings, etc. to understand the topology of the region.

4.  **Portrait mode and other image effects**:  
    Different filters and effects used over the images use image segmentation to identify the regions of interest (such as the face, object, etc.) for processing. Google highlights the usage of this technique in its blog, which you can read in your own time.
