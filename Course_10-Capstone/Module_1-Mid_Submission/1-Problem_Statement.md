# Problem Statement

Hello, Everyone! Welcome to this Capstone Project, offered by upGrad. Now that you have reached the end of this course on machine learning and cloud, it’s time for you to work on an end-to-end business problem. From preparing the data to feature engineering, building your machine learning models and deploying them, you will be facing various challenges in this project. 

## **Business Problem**

So, let's watch the upcoming video to understand the overall business scenario.

**VIDEO**

As you learnt in the video above, this Capstone project is based on the domain of the telecom sector. You will be working with a telecom data set and will be required to develop a model to help a company run different marketing campaigns and data monetisation activities around it. So, let's try to understand the biggest challenge faced by the company in the telecom sector.

Suppose XYZ Company, a telecom giant, wants to conduct some customer-driven campaigns as per certain users' gender and age preferences. However, the company may not rely on the Aadhaar information provided by the users at the time of purchasing SIM cards. So, in this Capstone Project, you will be predicting the demographics of certain users (gender and age) based on their app download and usage behaviour.

The data set was collected from a software development kit (SDK) that was integrated within the users' mobile applications. It serves under the service term between the Network Provider and the mobile app developers. The complete information of an individual user of an app has not been not provided due to privacy protection laws; therefore, you are required to build a model using the information provided on the users' application download and usage behaviour. Please treat the users' gender and age as real ground truth for prediction. 

## **Problem Statement** 

So, now that you have understood the overall business problem, let's watch the next video to understand the specific target and objective that you are required to achieve.

**VIDEO**

As you learnt in the video above, in this particular Capstone project, you are required to build a model that will predict the demographics of certain users, i.e., their age and gender. For building this model, you have been provided with the data on the users' app downloads and user behaviour. This data will give you information on the details of the mobile phone owned by the users, the activities performed by the users, their GPS coordinates, etc. Now, your aim is to predict the age and the gender of a particular user using this data.

Once you have predicted the gender and age for each user, your next task will be to map that particular user to the given target-specific ad campaigns. These campaigns aim to improve customer experience and open avenues for revenue generation through cross-selling and upselling activities, and for partnership with other companies for data monetisation activities.

## **Data Collection Process**

Now that you have understood the business scenario and the current problem statement at hand, the next step is to understand how the data is being generated and what customer-relevant information is available with us for our modelling purposes. Before exploring the data set, let's watch the next video to quickly understand what type of data we currently have and how it is being generated.

**VIDEO**

In the video above, you learnt how the data is collected through the SDK, which stands for **S**oftware **D**evelopment **K**it. An SDK is a set of tools that can be used to create and develop various applications. Examples of SDKs include the Windows 7 SDK, the Mac OS X SDK, and the iPhone SDK.

For example, SDKs help us understand the different apps that are available on a particular mobile phone and determine whether or not the apps are active at the time of data collection. These SDKs help us extract relevant data points, which in turn enable us to perform consumer drive analytics.

In the next segment, you will explore the available data set along with the complete end-to-end cycle that you will be performing while developing the model.
