# Introduction

Till now, you have learnt the theoretical concepts of RNN and its variants: long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Now, you will see how to frame a problem statement and solve it practically using a case study implementation in TensorFlow Python using Google Colab. Then, you will also see how some giants in the IT industry such as Google and Apple use RNN-based models to make their products better.

This session aims at driving you towards problem-solving using RNN so that you can also take up challenges on your own and solve them practically.

**In this session**

You’ll learn the following:

-   Predictive maintenance case study
-   Real life case studies
-   Relevance of LSTM

## You’ll be hearing from
