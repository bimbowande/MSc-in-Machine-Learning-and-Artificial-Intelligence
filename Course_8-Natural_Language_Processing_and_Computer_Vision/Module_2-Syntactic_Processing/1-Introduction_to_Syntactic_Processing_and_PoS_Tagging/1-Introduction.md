# Introduction

Welcome to the module on ‘Syntactic Processing’. In the previous module on lexical processing, you learnt the following techniques:

-   Regular expressions
-   Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization
-   Bag of Words and TF-IDF models
-   Cosine similarity and n-grams

You also learnt how to apply lexical processing techniques to build a classifier and how features can be created using the text data to build an ML model.

In this module, you will learn about the algorithms and techniques that are used to analyse the syntax or the grammatical structure of sentences. In this module, you will learn about:

-   PoS tags and PoS tagging techniques, in which you will learn algorithms such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to build PoS taggers.
-   Code demonstrations of PoS tagging using the SpaCy library in Python.
-   Name Entity Recognition (NER) and its python demonstration using SpaCy library.

## In this session you will be introduced to the following topics:

-   Syntax and syntactic processing
-   Parts of speech and PoS tagging
-   PoS tagging techniques: Rule-based and Hidden Markov Model
-   PoS tagging python code demonstration

## People you will hear from in this session
