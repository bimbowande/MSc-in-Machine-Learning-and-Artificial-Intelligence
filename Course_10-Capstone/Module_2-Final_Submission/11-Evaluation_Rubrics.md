| 1      | Reading Data and Cleaning Data                              | 5%        | All data quality checks are performed, and the reasons for missing/inconsistent data are mentioned; all data preparation steps are performed correctly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 2      | EDA, Visualisation, Feature Engineering                     | 25%       | Relevant EDA is done using plots and summaries. The insights from EDA should be clearly derived and explained.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 3      | Model Building, Hyperparameter Tuning  and Model Evaluation | 25%       | Model hyperparameters are tuned using correct principles, and the approach is explained clearly. Correct variable selection techniques are used.   A reasonable number of different models is attempted, and the best one is chosen based on key performance metrics.   Model evaluation is conducted correctly and tests the accuracy, stability and generalisability of the model.   Model evaluation metrics are at par with the best possible models on this data set. The rejected population is used to assess model performance. |
| 4      | Model Deployment                                            | 20%       | Models are successfully deployed on EC2 instances and exposed as API Endpoints.     All the subtasks involved in designing the flask application are met, and finally, the application displays the predictions and campaigns that are suitable for a particular device id.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 5      | Documentation                                               | 5%        | A report is created to explain the most important results concisely. The final recommendations include a brief explanation of the important variables, the model and the implications of using the model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
