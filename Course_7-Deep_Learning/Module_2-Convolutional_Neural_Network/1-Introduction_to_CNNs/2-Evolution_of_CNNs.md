# Evolution of CNNs

Although the vanilla neural networks (MLPs) can learn extremely complex functions, their architecture does not exploit what we know about how the brain reads and processes images. For this reason, although MLPs are successful in solving many complex problems, they have not been able to achieve any major breakthroughs in the image processing domain.  

On the other hand, the architecture of CNNs uses many of the working principles of the animal visual system and, thus, they have been able to achieve extraordinary results in image-related learning tasks.

The upcoming video will help you understand how image processing has evolved over time.

The following image summarises the evolution of computer vision discussed in the video.

### Evolution of CNNs

As can be seen, the pre-2000s era showed progress from a theoretical standpoint in processing visual data, but the lack of resources like computing power, GPUs and the unavailability of visual data resulted in slower progress. However, from the late 1990s, the development in these sections have resulted in speedy development.

### The ImageNet Challenge

The ImageNet challenge has been the benchmark of testing image processing frameworks for the past decade. CNNs had first demonstrated their extraordinary performance in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). The ILSVRC uses a list of about 1,000 image categories or ‘classes’ and has about 1.2 million training images (have increased over years). The original objective of this challenge is image classification.

You can see the impressive results of CNNs in the ILSVRC and how they have transformed image processing since the 2010s. Over the period, there have been many variants of CNNs like AlexNet and VGGNet which have gotten better with time. This can be seen from the error rate of these architectures on the ImageNet data set. It started from nearly 30% in 2010 and has now reduced to nearly 4% with the ResNet architecture, which is one of the recent variants of CNN. This event is significant as the error rate is even lesser than that of a human (5%).

The entire process has taken a lot of time to deliver fruitful results. In the next segment, you will study the different challenges associated with image processing that led to this delay.
