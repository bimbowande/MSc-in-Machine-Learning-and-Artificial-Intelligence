# Summary

We have reached the end of this session. In the forthcoming video, we will look at your learning so far.

So, here is a summary of your learning from this session:

1.  First, you were introduced to computer vision and its applications. You were briefly introduced to the four areas where CV can be applied:
    1.  Image classification
    2.  Object detection
    3.  Semantic segmentation
    4.  Instance segmentation  
         
2.  Next, you learnt how image classification differs from object detection.  
     
3.  After being introduced to the basics of object detection, you learnt about the concept of object localisation. Here is what you learnt under this topic:
    1.  Bounding box coordinates and the bounding box vector, which is shown below:  
        $\large{\begin{bmatrix}b_x\\b_y\\b_h\\b_w\end{bmatrix}}$
    2.  IoU, that is, intersection over union, which is given by this formula:  
        $IoU=\dfrac{\text{Area of intersection}}{\text{Area of union}}$  
        ![Numerator and Denominator of IoU](https://i.ibb.co/pPcL2Pq/Numerator-and-Denominator-of-Io-U.png)  
         
    3.  Loss functions:
        1.  L1 loss, which is calculated using this formula:   
            $\large{\sum^n_{i=1}|y_{true}−y_{predicted}|}$  
             
        2.  L2 loss, which is calculated using this formula:  
            $\large{\sum^n_{i=1}\left(y_{true}−y_{predicted}\right)^2}$

In the next segment, you will be attempting graded questions, which will test your learning from this session.
