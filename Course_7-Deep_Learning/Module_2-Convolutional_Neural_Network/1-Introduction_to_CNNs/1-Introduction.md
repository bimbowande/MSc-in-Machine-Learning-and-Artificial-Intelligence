# Introduction

Welcome to the module on 'Convolutional Neural Networks'.

Convolutional Neural Networks, or CNNs, are neural networks specialised to work with visual data, i.e., images and videos (though not restricted to them). They are very similar to the vanilla neural networks or the multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), where every neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer. They also follow the same general principles of feedforward, backpropagation, weights, biases, etc. However, there are certain features of CNNs that make them perform extremely well on image processing tasks. This module will help you learn all these aspects in detail.

Let’s start our module by first understanding a few use cases associated with CNNs.

As mentioned in the video, CNNs mainly deal with visual data. Let's now hear about the limitations of the basic artificial neural network (ANN) framework while dealing with visual data.

The ANN architecture can solve any problem, but there are two main limitations associated with the simple MLP architectures:

1.  The architecture offers a wide range of variations in the network through depth (number of layers), width (size of the layer), activation functions, etc., that make it impossible to find the best architecture for a given problem.
    
2.  The MLP architecture does not have the capability to preserve any spatial information from the underlying image. As you have seen while working with the MNIST data set in the previous module, the information stored in a 2-D or 3-D format is flattened into a 1-D array to map one neuron to each pixel.

So, these reasons resulted in the development of the CNN architecture, which has tried to solve the problems that existed with the simple MLP architectures.

## In this module

Now that you understand why CNNs came into the picture, let’s see the concepts that will be covered in this module in the upcoming video.

**VIDEO**

The video summarises the contents of the module. By the end of this module, you will be able to understand the working principles of CNNs, draw comparisons between various CNN architectures and be able to choose the right architecture and associated parameters for the required tasks. As part of transfer learning, you will also learn how to use large pre-trained networks for your own visual processing tasks. Moreover, you will be equipped with building CNN models using TensorFlow libraries.

## In this session

The first session will introduce you to the convolutional neural networks. The upcoming video provides an overview of all the elements covered in this session.
