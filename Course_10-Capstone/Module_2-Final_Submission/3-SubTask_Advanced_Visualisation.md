# SubTask: Advanced Visualisation

In the previous segment, you learnt about the different EDA subtasks that you need to perform and some feature engineering ideas that you can use while building your models. In the next subtask, you need to perform advanced visualisations and the necessary preprocessing for building your models. So, let's watch the next video for a brief overview of these subtasks.

In the video above, you learnt how to visualise the geospatial data and understood its application process across various industries. This type of technique is used to visualise the latitude and longitude data and identify any hidden patterns that may exist within the data, e.g., the concentration of customers across different parts of a country. 

In the next video, Arihant will show you a short demonstration on geospatial visualisation using different Python libraries. The data set and code files used for the demonstration can be download from the links provided below.

In the video above, Arihant demonstrated the different Python libraries that can be used to conduct geospatial visualisation. A common tool used for visualising geographic data is the **Basemap toolkit**, which is one of several Matplotlib toolkits under the **mpl_toolkits.**

Now that you have understood the importance of geospatial visualisation and learnt how to apply it using appropriate Python libraries, in the next video, Arihant will explain the various EDA tasks that you need to perform using this geospatial visualisation.

In the video above, Arihant explained some specific geospatial visualisation tasks that you are expected to perform in this Capstone Project. These tasks are as follows:

-   Plot the visualisation plot for a sample of 1 lakh data points.
    
-   Compare the event visualisation plots based on the users' gender information. \[This can be done on the sample of 1 lakh data points.\]
    
-   Compare the event visualisation plots based on the following age groups:
    
    -   0–24 
        
    -   25–32
        
    -   32+

Now that you have learnt about the various visualisation exercises that you need to complete, in the next segment, you will learn how to use clustering as a preprocessing technique for improving your models.
