# Introduction

Welcome to the second session of the module on lexical processing. In the last session, you learnt about regular expressions and their use cases. That was an essential skill to learn before trying your hand at any kind of text processing. You also learnt about several applications of NLP in the previous session.

## In this session

In this session, you will learn about basic lexical processing. You will understand the various preprocessing or text cleaning steps that you need to follow to do any kind of text analytics, such as applying machine learning on textual data, building language models, building chatbots and building sentiment analysis systems. These steps are used in almost all applications that work with textual data. 

Specifically, you will learn the following:

-   How to preprocess text using techniques such as:
    
    -   Text encoding,
        
    -   Tokenisation,
        
    -   Stop words removal,
        
    -   Stemming, and
        
    -   Lemmatisation.
        

Finally, you will learn about these steps with a hands-on approach using Zomato customers’ review data set.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this session other than knowledge of the topics discussed in the previous session.
