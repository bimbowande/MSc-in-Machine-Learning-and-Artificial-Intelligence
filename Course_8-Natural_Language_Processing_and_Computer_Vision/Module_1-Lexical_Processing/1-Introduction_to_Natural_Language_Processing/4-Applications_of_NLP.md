# Applications of NLP

In this segment, you will look into some possible applications of NLP. It is not possible to cover all the applications in a limited time frame and, hence, we have tried to cover a few based on various industries. In the upcoming video, Dr Balan will give examples of a few NLP applications.

In the video, Dr Balan spoke about e-commerce and healthcare domains. 

### E-Commerce 

Ecommerce businesses usually collect text information in the form of reviews from users. They can be product reviews or service reviews and so on. A lot of information can be extracted from these reviews. You can find the sentiment of the reviews, the major topics being spoken about and so on. 

### Healthcare

The healthcare industry is the most difficult to implement any of the ML solutions. The data is sensitive in nature. Most of it is in a non-digital form, and labelling data from healthcare is extremely expensive. Having said that, healthcare can be a very important field for ML products. Healthcare has many NLP applications such as treatment prediction and name entity extraction. 

For instance, consider entity extraction. A language model needs to be able to identify a medical condition and the corresponding treatment from a piece of text. Once these models are trained enough, they can start recommending treatments to the doctor. Such recommendation systems can increase the capacity of doctors to examine patients. 

Let’s look at a few more NLP applications in the upcoming video.

As you saw in the videos, NLP is an extremely wide field and finds applications in a lot of different fields. 

### Fintech

The fintech is always at the forefront of adopting new technologies such as NLP. One such example of NLP from the fintech world is CLEO. The application can go through a person's bank records and tag each of the expenditures in relevant categories such as utilities, food and beverage and medicines. How do you think these tags are identified? Yes, a language model is trained to process the bank record entries and classify them into different groups. These classes can then be used to generate expenditure reports and so on. 

### Recommendation Systems

All the major tech companies such as Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google (FAANG) use recommendation systems in some way or form. In the video earlier, Dr Balan explained a few applications of these recommendation systems. 

### Sentiment Analysis on tweets

Nowadays, large brands are highly cognizant of the image they have in the public. Consider any brand and it will have an image in your mind. These brands use data from social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook to maintain their image. NLP is used heavily to score the overall sentiment of people about the company. This analytics gives them the opportunity to take corrective measures if their image is changing. 

The list of NLP applications does not stop here. You can also refer to the following links to know more about the application of text analytics.

Up to this point you have seen NLP applications where input text was converted to information. But what about applications like Alexa? Do they also use NLP? Obviously yes, but they also use a different part of NLP called natural language generation (NLG). 

Any complete conversation has two parts – receiving information and responding to the information. Same is the case with chatbot solutions. They are built out of a combination of NLP and NLG. The upcoming video will explain the differences between NLP and NLG.

Now that you understand the subtle differences between NLP and NLG, let’s look at a couple of examples of text generation. You can also generate a new text based on the context you give [here](https://app.inferkit.com/demo). 

#### NLP vs NLG

Qn: Which of the following is not an example of NLG?

- Closed captioning (automatic generation of subtitles) in YouTube videos

- Image identification by Google Lens

- Autocorrect in WhatsApp

- Weather prediction based on air pressure and humidity

Ans: C. *This is an example of NLP as the autocorrect feature uses only text to determine whether a given word is typed correctly or not.*

#### Applications of NLP

Qn: Can you think of another application of NLP in the entertainment industry?

Ans: *NLP can understand which player was talked about the most on social media in the Euro 2021 league.*

With all that being said, in the next segment, let’s start learning about the most fundamental task in language processing regular expression
