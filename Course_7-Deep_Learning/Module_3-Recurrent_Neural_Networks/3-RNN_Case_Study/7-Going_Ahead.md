# Going Ahead

In this course, you first learnt that CNN and ANN are not are not sufficient to solve all kinds of problems. Then, researchers came up with a new idea of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, RNNs were not able to learn long-term dependency for which researchers further came up with the idea of gating mechanism in LSTM. Following similar lines, they developed GRU as a simpler alternative to LSTM.

While LSTM is still being used for many use cases, they are still not excellent in some advanced tasks such as machine translation. Now, as technology evolves, new techniques have been developed on the top of sequential models, such as attention-based models and transformers, to get even better results.

You will get to learn more about these models in the later module.

As we sign off from this module, let’s end it with some motivating words from the Professor.

In this session, you solved a case study on predictive maintenance which belongs to the many-to-one category of RNNs. You learnt to preprocess the dataset, build the model, then train it and evaluate it finally. You saw that even a simple LSTM model can perform decently which is reflected in the test set accuracy of 97.8%.

Most importantly, you solved a problem, which has the potential to change how the aviation industry operates and help avoid the problems of engine failure. Now think about other types of engines as well, they also need maintenance, right. Once you acquire the dataset you can always solve the same problem for different industries.

You also learnt:

1.  To convert a business problem to a data problem
2.  To use raw features to create some trainable features and the target variable
3.  Real-life case studies such as Google’s image captioning, Google’s Neural machine translation and Amazon’s virtual voice assistant Alexa.

The important thing when it comes to applying RNNs is identifying the type of problem, choosing a suitable architecture, pre-processing the data and, of course, getting your hands dirty and experimenting with real-world problems.

That brings us to the end of the module on RNNs. We hope that you have learnt how to apply RNNs to real-world scenarios.

**Best of luck. Happy Learning!**
