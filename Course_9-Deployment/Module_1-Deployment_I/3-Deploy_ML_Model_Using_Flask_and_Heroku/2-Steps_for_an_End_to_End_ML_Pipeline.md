# Steps for an End-to-End ML Pipeline

Before we delve into the hands-on session on end-to-end model deployment using Flask and Heroku, you will hear from Mithun as he recalls the steps for deploying a machine learning (ML) model in the forthcoming video.

To summarize, the steps to create an end-to-end ML pipeline are as follows:

1.  Data acquisition
2.  Data Preprocessing
3.  Feature engineering
4.  Training the model
5.  Saving the model
6.  Creating an API using Flask
7.  Creating a web page

It is important to understand why you need to save and load an ML model.

One of the most important reasons to save and load an ML model is to make predictions later on the same model. This will save a lot of resources and time. 

You will learn about encapsulation in detail using Python’s “pickle” library in the hands-on session.

There are two ways to save and load an ML model:

-   **Serialization:** It can be referred to as saving or writing Python objects to disk.
-   **Deserialization:** It is referred to as reading a saved object from disk.
