# Kubeflow User Interface - Introduction

In the previous segment, you have learnt how Kubeflow can be used to build an end to end ML pipeline. Now, in this segment, you will see how a Kubeflow user interface looks like.

Let’s listen to Abhay and take the brief about the UI of Kubeflow.

So, there are many things that a Kubeflow UI includes, which can be listed below as:

-   **Home**: A centralised dashboard for navigation between the Kubeflow components.
-   **Pipelines**: A Kubeflow Pipelines dashboard.
-   **Notebook**: There is a button for Jupyter Notebooks.
-   **Katib**: It is used for hyperparameter tuning.
-   **Artifact Store**: It is used for tracking of artifact metadata.
-   **Manage Contributors**: It is for sharing user access across namespaces in the Kubeflow deployment.

The Kubelfow UI looks like below:

You will learn to access the Kubeflow using Kubernetes on AWS in the next segments. And you will have a demonstration on Kubeflow dashboard.
