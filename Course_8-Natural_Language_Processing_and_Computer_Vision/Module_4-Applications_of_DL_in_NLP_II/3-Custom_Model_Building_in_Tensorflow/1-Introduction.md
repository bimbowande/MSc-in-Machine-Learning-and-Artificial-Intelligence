# Introduction

Welcome to the session on **Custom Model Building in Tensorflow.** 

Until now, you have worked with the simple and traditional kind of approach to build a model using the Keras wrapper in Tensorflow. Most of the time the built-in layers and pre-trained models do the job but what if you want to create your own custom models or layers? 

The Tensorflow framework allows us to create models ranging from simple to complex architecture. In the world of deep learning, developers may come from a varied set of background or experience levels. TensorFlow understands this and provides you with different approaches whether you’re a beginner or an experienced person.

In the next video, let's understand how we can do that and look at the different type of approaches which you can utilise for model building.

**VIDEO**

The **tf.keras** is TensorFlow’s implementation of the Keras API specification. Now Keras has become a high-level API to build and train models in TensorFlow 2.0 and higher versions. As explained in the video, there are three methods to implement your own neural network architectures in TensorFlow:

-   Sequential API
-   Functional API
-   Model Subclassing

## In this session

In this session, you will understand how to work with custom models and layers using the TensorFlow framework. This session will introduce you to the following topics: 

-   Introduction 
-   Sequential vs Functional API
-   Model Subclassing
-   Building Custom Models
-   Building Custom Layers
-   Building Datasets
-   Building Custom Training Loops
