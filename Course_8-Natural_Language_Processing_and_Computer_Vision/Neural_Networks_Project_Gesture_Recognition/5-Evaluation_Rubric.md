| **Criteria**    | **Meets Expectation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Does Not Meet Expectations**                                                                                        |

| Generator (40%) | The generator is able to successfully input a batch of videos to the model. Weightages have been allocated to the correct list creation of img_idx, initialization of the batch, correctly looping over the data points in a batch and cropping, resizing and normalisation of the images. | The generator function is not able to input a batch of videos (list of frames) to the model.                          |
| Model (30%)     | The model is able to train without any errors. You should get a good accuracy with the least possible parameters. There is a weightage given to the structure of the model.                                                                                                                | The model is not able to train properly: loss increases/plateaus instead of decreasing with the number of epochs.     |
| Write-up (30%)  | The write-up should have detailed steps followed in the given format with the reason/logic behind adding more layers, changing filter size, cropping, resizing and other experiments you have performed. The metric values used to take a decision should be mentioned.                    | The write-up does not have an explanation for the experiments performed/ does not have clear metric values mentioned. |
