# Summary

In this session, you learnt about the different areas where text analytics and its applications are used in healthcare, ecommerce, retail, financial and various other industries. You also understood the place of language processing tools in machine learning architecture. You learnt that there are three levels in text analytics as follows:

1.  Lexical processing
2.  Syntactic processing
3.  Semantic processing

Then you learnt about **regular expressions**. You learnt how to manipulate and extract the information that you want from a given text corpus using regular expressions. In regular expressions, you learnt about **quantifiers**, their different types and how they are used to mention the number of times a character(s) is present. You learnt about the **anchor** characters (^ and $) and the **wildcard** (.). Then you learnt about the **character sets** and **meta-sequences** which are shorthand for common character sets. 

  
You can refer to this link whenever you want a refresher in regular expressions in Python. We have left some of the concepts untouched in regular expressions. But as someone who is working in the area of text analytics, you can achieve pretty much everything using the tools that you have learnt.
