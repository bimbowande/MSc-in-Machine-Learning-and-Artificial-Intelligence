# Introduction to Heroku

In the previous segment, you learned how to deploy ML models using Flask in local. In this segment, you will learn about Heroku and understand how to create a public web application. 

In the forthcoming video, you will learn about IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.

Now that you have learned about cloud computing, we will next look at the following four of its types and discuss the differences between them:

-   On-premises
-   IaaS
-   PaaS
-   SaaS

We will take real-world examples to help you understand the concepts better. 
  
Suppose you buy a car and you own it. This will be your on-premise service.
  
Now, suppose you take a car on lease. In this case, you may choose your car and drive it, but you do not own it. This is infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

Imagine that you are traveling in a taxi. Here, you do not own the car, nor can you drive it, although you can use the platform. This is platform as a service (PaaS).
  
The fourth type is software as a service (SaaS). We can compare it to a bus. Here, you do not have to do much; in other words, you only have to go to the bus stop and take a bus.
  
Moving on, we will now help you to understand the above four types of cloud computing by understanding their definitions.
  
This table shows the differences between the four types.

In the table, the pink cells indicate the services managed by vendors, whereas the blue cells indicate the services managed by servers.
  
**What Is Heroku?**

Heroku is categorized under PaaS (platform as a service), and it helps developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. In the next segment, you will learn how to deploy an ML model using Heroku.

#### Analogy On-Premises, PAAS, SAAS and IAAS.

Qn: You want to have pizza for dinner and have a nice evening out. So you decide to dine out.  
 
- PaaS

- SaaS

- IaaS

- On-Premises

Ans: B. *Dine out and having dinner is a service that the restaurant is providing.*

Qn: You decide that you want to cook pizza at home. So you make everything at home, including the cheese and the topping.

- PaaS

- IaaS

- SaaS

- On-Premises

Ans: D. *Making pizza at home is an on-premise task

Qn: You cook pizza at home, but you buy the raw materials and cook the pizza at home.

- PaaS

- SaaS

- IaaS

- On-Premises

Ans: C. *Cooking the pizza at home with all ingredients is related to infrastructure.*

Qn: You decide to get the pizza delivered to your home. What is the type of service that you are opting for here?  

- PaaS

- IaaS

- SaaS

- On-Premises

Ans: A. *Delivering the pizza to your home relates to platform as a service.*
