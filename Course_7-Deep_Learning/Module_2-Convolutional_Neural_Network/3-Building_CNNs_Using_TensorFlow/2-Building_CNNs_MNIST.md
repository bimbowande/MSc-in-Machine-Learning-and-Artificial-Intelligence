# Building CNNs - MNIST

In this segment, you will learn how to build CNNs in TensorFlow. Specifically, you will learn to build and train a CNN on the MNIST data set to classify the digits into one of the ten classes (0-9). 

This is a **text-only** page (with an IPython Notebook) whose objective is to make you familiar with building CNNs in TensorFlow. This is slightly different from the previous demonstration on the CIFAR-10 data set, as it deals with greyscale images. 

Please download the Notebook given below and go through it. You need not download the data set separately; it can be downloaded from the API directly (as done in the Notebook). 

You can run this Notebook **without a GPU**, as the architecture is simple and has fewer epochs. Make sure that you understand the section 'Understanding Model Summary' in the Notebook well; it will be required to solve the questions on the next page.

In the next segment, you will test your understanding of the concepts covered in the notebook by solving some questions on the VGG-16 architecture.
