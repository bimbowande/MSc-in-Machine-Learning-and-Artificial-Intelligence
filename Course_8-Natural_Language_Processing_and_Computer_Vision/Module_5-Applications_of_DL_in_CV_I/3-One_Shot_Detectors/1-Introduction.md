# Introduction

In the previous session, you learnt about the workings of region-based algorithms for solving object detection tasks and understood why that approach is not suitable for real-time problems.

## In this session

You will learn about the second set of object detection algorithms: **One-shot detectors**. In the forthcoming video, we will listen to Georgios as he provides us with an overview of this session.

**VIDEO**

In the previous session, you saw region-based detectors that used two forward passes to solve object detection tasks as mentioned below:

1.  In the first pass, several regions are proposed where the objects are likely to be found.
2.  And in the second pass, only those regions are scrutinized to detect the object(s) using CNNs.

This session will cover **one-shot detectors**, which, as the name suggests, use a single step to detect the objects present in a given image. You will learn about two one-shot detectors in this session:

1.  **YOLO** - You only look once
2.  **SSD** - Single-shot detector

The session will discuss how these algorithms learn and function. You learn how to work with pre-trained models and solve use cases on object detection.

You will start the session by learning about the YOLO detector, its working and its architecture. This will be followed by solving a real-world problem of traffic surveillance.

Next, you will learn about the SSD detector and how it works. You will also learn about the architecture of this detector and then predict human faces in images using a pre-trained model. We will also look at a comparison of these two techniques.

In this session, you will be working with pre-trained models for both YOLO and SSD. In the last session of this module, you will also get to learn about custom models that will equip you with the techniques required to build a fully customised model according to your requirements.
