# Computer Vision

**Computer vision**, as mentioned earlier, deals with how a computer **perceives** and **performs** **operations** or **tasks** on a given image or video. This field is of wide importance and deals with a large selection of applications. Before we understand these applications in detail, you will learn a bit about the evolution of computer vision over the past years. 

In the forthcoming video, Georgios will take you through the evolution of CV and its use cases over the years.

**VIDEO**

CV began in the 1960s as a simple collection of methods for processing black-and-white images produced by early industrial cameras. Over time, it has evolved to process greyscale and colour images (both 2D and 3D), as well as video, utilising increasingly complex algorithms. Now, CV applications can be used for complex tasks, such as self-driving cars and face detection. The image below shows the evolution of CV’s applications.

Now, based on your understanding of CV, try answering these questions.

#### Computer Vision

Qn: Which of these statements about CV are correct?

- CV aims to replicate how the human vision perceives a certain image or video.

- CV is a field of artificial intelligence.

- CV has the capability to recreate a 3D scene by analysing a 2D input image.

- Robotics is not an application of CV.

Ans: A, B & C. *CV allows computers to perceive an image or a video and analyse it in a way similar to the human brain. CV is a field of artificial intelligence. CV can take a 2D image as input and extract different features to reconstruct a 3D scenario from that image.*

Modern CV, in combination with machine learning (ML), is tasked frequently with addressing four common problems:

-   Image classification,
-   Object detection,
-   Semantic segmentation and
-   Instance segmentation.

The image below shows the applications of CV in addressing these four problems.

Now, try answering these questions based on your understanding of the image provided above.

#### Applications of CV

Qn: From your understanding, what is the task being performed in the ‘Image Recognition’ part shown above.

- The animals present in the image are being located.

- The classes of the animals present in the image are being provided.

- The animals present in the image are divided based on the pixels.

Ans: B. *Image recognition/classification would classify the animals present in the image and provide the probabilities of each class.*

Qn: What, according to your understanding of ‘Object Detection’, is happening in the corresponding image?

- Each animal is being categorised into a different class.

- The locations of the animals are being identified by the boxes around them.

- Both of the above.

Ans: C. *Object detection would classify the animals and also provide the coordinates of their locations. Hence, both the options are correct.*

Qn: Based on your understanding of the image aboves, how is the semantic segmentation task different from object detection?

- Object detection classifies an object and draws a box around it, thus marking its location.

- Semantic segmentation classifies objects and draws a box around them, thus marking their locations.

- Semantic segmentation categorises the objects in an image into different classes based on their pixels.

- Object detection categorises the objects in an image into different classes based on their pixels.

Ans: A & C. *Object detection classifies the objects in an image and also locates them by drawing a bounding box. Semantic segmentation classifies objects based on their pixels but does not compute the location coordinates.*

Qn: What, from your understanding of the images, is the difference between semantic and instance segmentation?

- Semantic segmentation considers all the objects of the same class as the same entity.

- Instance segmentation considers each object as an individual entity.

- Instance segmentation considers all objects of the same class as the same entity.

- Semantic segmentation considers each object as an individual entity.

Ans: A & B. *As shown in the corresponding image, semantic segmentation considers the flock of sheep as the same entity; hence, they are represented by the same colour. As shown in the corresponding image, instance segmentation considers each animal, a dog or sheep, as a different entity; hence, they are represented by different colours.*

Please note that the exercise above is only for giving an intuition about the different applications of CV. Do not worry if your answers were incorrect; you will be learning about these applications in detail later in the module.

So, now that you have a basic understanding of the different applications of CV, in the upcoming segment, we will discuss **object detection** in more detail.
