# Introduction

In earlier modules, you learned about the various aspects of machine learning and model selection. You also learned how to train a model and put it to use.

In this module, you will learn how to deploy those machine learning models so that they can be used on other systems as well. So, let’s get started!

The next video will give you an introduction to machine learning in various fields.

**VIDEO**

So far, you have performed machine learning techniques on a certain set of data using train and test sets. But in reality, you take the example of, let's say, **YouTube**, wherein using your preferences, it recommends new videos. Don't you wonder how it is making recommendations using your browsing history in real time?

Machine learning is used in almost every sphere of our lives. After **model training**, the next step is to deploy the model. Machine learning deployment is a process in which we make our models available in the production environment. Deployment is an important step in model deployment because models start adding value only after they are deployed. 

Given below is the flow of this module:

1.   Machine Learning Pipeline
2.   Introduction to Git and GitHub
3.   Introduction to API and REST
4.  Introduction to Flask and Heroku
5.   Deploy a Machine Learning Model in Heroku Using Flask (PaaS)
6.   Deploying a Machine Learning Model on Docker  

## In this session

We will discuss the following concepts:

-   Machine learning pipeline
-   Visualisation of deployment
-   Software architecture of deployment
-   Version control systems
-   Git and GitHub
